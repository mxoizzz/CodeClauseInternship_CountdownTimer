## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters an event name.
2. User selects a future date and time.
3. On clicking **Start Countdown**:
   - The application calculates the time difference between the current time and the target time.
   - The countdown updates every second using `setInterval`.
4. When the countdown reaches zero, the timer stops automatically.
